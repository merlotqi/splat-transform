/**
 * @brief Sort Gaussian splats in Morton order (Z-order curve) for memory locality
 *
 * This function computes a Morton ordering (Z-order curve) of the Gaussian splats
 * based on their 3D positions to improve cache locality and memory access patterns.
 * The Morton code interleaves the bits of the 3D coordinates to create a 1D ordering
 * that preserves spatial proximity in multi-dimensional space.
 *
 * @param dataTable Pointer to the DataTable containing Gaussian splat data.
 *                  Expected to have at least 'x', 'y', and 'z' columns representing
 *                  the 3D positions of the splats.
 * @param indices Output span that will be filled with the sorted indices in Morton order.
 *                Must be pre-allocated with size equal to the number of rows in dataTable.
 *                On output, indices[i] contains the original index of the i-th splat
 *                in Morton order.
 *
 * @note The function assumes the position coordinates are normalized or bounded.
 * @note Morton ordering is particularly effective for octree-based rendering and
 *       improves performance for spatially coherent operations.
 * @note This is a key optimization for real-time Gaussian splatting rendering pipelines.
