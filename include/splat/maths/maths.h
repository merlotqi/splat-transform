 * in machine learning for probabilities and activations.
 *
 * @tparam T Numeric type (float, double, etc.)
 * @param x Input value
 * @return Sigmoid-transformed value in range (0, 1)
 *
 * @note For Gaussian splatting, this is typically used to convert raw opacity
 *       values to valid opacity in [0, 1] range.
 * @note Uses double-precision exponential for accuracy even with float input.

 *
 * @note This is a simple PRNG suitable for debugging, testing, or situations
 *       where reproducibility is more important than statistical quality.
 * @note Not suitable for cryptographic or high-quality statistical applications.
 * @note The generator uses the constants from POSIX rand() implementation:
 *       multiplier = 1103515245, increment = 12345, modulus = 2^31.
 * @note Thread-unsafe: uses static internal state.
