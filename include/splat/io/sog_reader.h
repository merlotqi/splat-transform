/**
 * @brief Reads and parses a Gaussian Splatting (.sog) file into a DataTable
 *
 * This function loads and decodes a Gaussian Splatting scene stored in .sog format.
 * The .sog format is a compressed representation of Gaussian splatting data that
 * stores position, scale, color, rotation, and optionally higher-order spherical
 * harmonics in an efficient texture-based encoding.
 *
 * The function supports two input modes:
 * 1. Reading from a single .sog ZIP archive file containing all components
 * 2. Reading from individual component files in a directory structure
 *
 * @param file Path to the main .sog file or directory containing component files
 * @param sourceName Source name/path used to locate component files. If sourceName
 *                   ends with ".sog", the function treats it as a ZIP archive.
 *                   Otherwise, it treats sourceName as a directory containing
 *                   individual component files.
 *
 * @return std::unique_ptr<DataTable> containing the decoded Gaussian splatting data.
 *         The DataTable contains the following columns (at minimum):
 *         - x, y, z: 3D positions (float)
 *         - scale_0, scale_1, scale_2: 3D scale factors (float)
 *         - f_dc_0, f_dc_1, f_dc_2: Spherical harmonic band 0 coefficients (RGB colors, float)
 *         - opacity: Opacity values (float)
 *         - rot_0, rot_1, rot_2, rot_3: Rotation quaternions (float)
 *         Additional columns for higher-order spherical harmonics (f_rest_*) are added
 *         if present in the source data.
 *
 * @throws std::runtime_error if:
 *         - The .sog file or component files cannot be opened/read
 *         - Required metadata (meta.json) is missing or invalid
 *         - Texture dimensions are insufficient for the declared splat count
 *         - File format inconsistencies are detected
 *
 * @note The function performs parallel processing using OpenMP for performance
 * @note Position coordinates are transformed using invLogTransform to restore
 *       the original coordinate space
 * @note Scale factors are decoded from a codebook-based quantization
 * @note Rotation quaternions are unpacked from a compressed 8-bit per channel representation
 * @note Colors and opacity are decoded from quantized SH0 coefficients with sigmoid inverse
 *       transformation for opacity
 * @note Higher-order spherical harmonics (bands > 0) are optionally decoded if present
 *       in the metadata
 *
 * @see Meta::parseFromJson
 * @see decodeMeans
 * @see unpackQuat
 * @see invLogTransform
 * @see sigmoidInv
