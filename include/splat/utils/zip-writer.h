 * A RAII-based ZIP archive writer that handles ZIP format encoding for uncompressed (STORED) files
 * using data descriptors. The class manages the entire ZIP file creation process including
 * Local File Headers, file data, Data Descriptors, and Central Directory Records.
 *
 * The writer supports:
 * - Creating ZIP archives with multiple files
 * - STORE compression method (no compression)
 * - Data descriptors for streaming writes
 * - Proper ZIP64 format handling for large files
 * - DOS-compatible timestamp encoding
 *
 * @note This implementation uses synchronous I/O and is not thread-safe
 * @note Files are written with the STORE method (uncompressed) for simplicity and speed
 * @note CRC-32 checksums are computed during writing for data integrity
